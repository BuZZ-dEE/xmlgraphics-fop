This is branch Temp_Interleaved_Page_Line_Breaking. It holds the
development of interleaved page and line breaking. That is, line
breaking is postponed until the page breaker requires the lines of the
paragraph. This allows the following features:

The page breaker can implement both the total fit strategy for a page
sequence and the best fit strategy for one page (or a range of
pages). The latter strategy allows one to have different widths for
different pages.

A single total fit strategy for page and line breaking.  Such a
strategy allows one to integrate the placement of side floats in the
page breaking calculations. The setup of such a strategy has not yet
been fully understood.
