/**
 * An instance of this class represents a piece of content with adjustable 
 * width: for example a space between words of justified text.
 * 
 * A KnuthGlue is a feasible breaking point only if it immediately follows
 * a KnuthBox.
 * 
 * The represented piece of content is suppressed if either the KnuthGlue
 * is a chosen breaking point or there isn't any KnuthBox between the
 * previous breaking point and the KnuthGlue itself.
 * 
 * So, an unsuppressible piece of content with adjustable width, for example
 * a leader or a word with adjustable letter space, cannot be represented
 * by a single KnuthGlue; it can be represented using the sequence:
 *   KnuthBox(width = 0)
 *   KnuthPenalty(width = 0, penalty = infinity)
 *   KnuthGlue(...)
 *   KnuthBox(width = 0)
 * where the infinity penalty avoids choosing the KnuthGlue as a breaking point
 * and the 0-width KnuthBoxes prevent suppression.
 * 
 * Besides the inherited methods and attributes, this class has two attributes
 * used to store the stretchability (difference between max and opt width) and
 * the shrinkability (difference between opt and min width), and the methods
 * to get these values.
