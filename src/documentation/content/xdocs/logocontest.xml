		<p>FOP needs new logo and FOP Team decided to hold an open logo contest. We invite all members of 
		the FOP community as well as any other interested parties to participate as contestants or by expressing 
		your opinion through voting. We have set up <link href="http://vote.sparklit.com/web_poll.spark/714566">Web Poll</link> where you can see
		contestant logos and vote.</p>

			<title>The rules</title>
