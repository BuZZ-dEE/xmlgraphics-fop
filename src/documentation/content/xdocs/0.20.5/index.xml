      <p>
        Version 0.20.5 represents Apache FOP's previous stable release.  It is now
        recommended that you use <a href="../0.93/index.html">0.93</a> instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please notice that, although we still provide support for 0.20.5, we won't fix any bugs or add any 
        new features to this branch of development anymore.
        Instead, please help us with <a href="../trunk/index.html">FOP Trunk</a> by trying it out and 
        sending us your feedback. Of course, we especially appreciate any contributions in the form of 
        documentation updates and code patches.
