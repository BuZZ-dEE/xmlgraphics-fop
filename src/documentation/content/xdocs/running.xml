      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>The following software must be installed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java 1.2.x or later.</li>
        <li>FOP. The <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/download.html">FOP distribution</jump> includes all libraries that you will need to run a basic FOP installation. These can be found in the xml-fop/lib directory. These libraries include the following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Apache <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html">Xerces-J</jump> for XML parsing. You can use other XML parsers which support SAX and DOM.</li>
          <li>Apache Xalan, an XSLT processor.</li>
          <li>Apache <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/">Batik</jump>, an SVG library.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Optional Libraries</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Instructions</title>
      <p>Basic FOP installation consists of first unzipping the <code>.gz</code> file that is the distribution medium, then unarchiving the resulting <code>.tar</code> file in a directory/folder that is convenient on your system. Please consult your operating system documentation or Zip application software documentation for instructions specific to your site.</p>

      <title>Problems</title>
      <p>Some Mac OSX users have experienced filename truncation problems using Stuffit to unzip and unarchive their distribution media. This is a legacy of older Mac operating systems, which had a 31-character pathname limit. Several Mac OSX users have recommended that Mac OSX users use the shell command <code>tar -xzf</code> instead.</p>

    <title>Starting FOP as a standalone application</title>
    <p>Review the batch file fop.bat or the shell script fop.sh to see how FOP is invoked.</p>
    <p>The standard scripts for starting FOP require that the environment variable JAVA_HOME be set to a path pointing to the appropriate Java installation on your system. Macintosh OSX includes a Java environment as part of its distribution. We are told by Mac OSX users that the path to use in this case is <code>/Library/Java/Home</code>. <strong>Caveat: </strong>We suspect that, as Apple releases new Java environments and as FOP upgrades the minimum Java requirements, the two will inevitably not match on some systems. Please see <jump href="http://developer.apple.com/java/faq">Java on Mac OSX FAQ</jump> for information as it becomes available.</p>
