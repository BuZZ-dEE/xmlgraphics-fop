  <title>Downloading FOP</title>
    <p>You can download the latest release version from the <link
       href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/fop/">distribution directory</link>. </p>
    <p>The file contains also the documentation (including some example fo files) and the source.  </p>
    <p>If you want to work with the latest and nicest code, you can use the cvs version. See the section
       on AnonCVS in the <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cvs.html">xml.apache.org documentation</link> for details.
       Sometimes people have difficulties to access the cvs server; in this case you can download
       a snapshot from the cvs files <link href="http://xml.apache.org/from-cvs/xml-fop/">here</link>.
       In both cases you have to build Fop yourself - see <link href="compiling.html">Compiling Fop</link> for details.
    </p>
    <note>
      Important: Currently, releases of FOP are coming out of the
      "fop-0_20_2-maintain" branch. The "MAIN" branch is currently
      under development. See <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/dev/index.html">Development Docs</link>
      for more information.
    </note>
    <p>To run FOP from the command line, see <link href="running.html">Running FOP</link>.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in embedding FOP in a Java application of your own, see
       <link href="embedding.html">Embedding FOP</link>.
