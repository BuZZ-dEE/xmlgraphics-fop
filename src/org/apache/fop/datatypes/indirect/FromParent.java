/**
 * A pseudo-class to represent a call to the core function from-parent().
 * Used <i>only</i> in the cases where the property assigned to
 * is identical to the <tt>NCName</tt> argument, and this is a shorthand.
 * <p>Further, the function call must be the only component of the expression
 * in which it occurs.  (See Rec. Section 5.10.4 Property Value Functions.)
 * In these circumstances, the function call resolves to a
 * from-parent() function call on each of the properties to
 * which the shorthand resolves.
 * <p>The use of the pseudo-type should ensure that the function call is not
 * involved in any arithmetic components of a more complex expression.  I.e,
 * the function evaluator in the parser must check to see whether the
 * property for which the from-parent() function is being
 * evaluated is a shorthand.  If not, the function is normally evaluated.
 * If so, the parser must further check that the property assigned to (i.e.
 * the property against which this function is being evaluated) is the same
 * as the <tt>NCName</tt> argument.  If not, it is an error.  If so, the
 * property evaluates to an instance of this class.  The value must itself
 * be later resolved before the property value can be utilised in the fo
 * node, but, in the meantime, any attempt to involve the function call in
 * any more complex expression will throw an exception.
 * <p>This mechanism ensures, without greatly complicating the parser,
 * that the constraint on the from-parent() function, with
 * respect to shorthands, is met.
 * <p>This pseudo-datatype is also used as the first stage of shorthand
 * expansion.  After a shorthand's expression is parsed, the next stage of
 * resolution will generate a FromParent object for each property
 * in the expansion of the shorthand.
 * <p>Once created, this class acts as an <tt>IndirectValue</tt> in the
 * event that it cannot immediately be resolved.  This association exists
 * simply to save creating another object.
