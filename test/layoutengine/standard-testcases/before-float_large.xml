  <info>
    <p>
      This test checks that a before-float too large to fit on a page alone is
      split on several pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently disabled as this feature still needs some debugging.

      Well, the result is highly dependent on the implemented algorithm. Tests
      will have to be added when it is implemented. Currently the float
      overflows the page instead of being split.
