Fop documentation (xml version)

The files in these directory contain the Fop documentation as xml files.
The directory xml-docs/fop is a mirror of the files in the cvs repository
modul 'xml-site' /sources/fop. These files are used to create the html
documentation on xml.apache.org.

Use the html target in the main build script in the xml-fop root directory.
You can create a pdf file containing the complete Fop documentation.
