FOP README

    What is FOP?
    FOP is the world's first print formatter driven by XSL formatting
    objects. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object
    tree conforming to the XSL 1.0 Recommendation (15 October 2001) and
    then turns it into a PDF document or allows you to preview it
    directly on screen.

    FOP is part of Apache's XML Graphics project. The homepage of FOP is
    http://xml.apache.org/fop.  Our resources page is at 
    http://xml.apache.org/fop/resources.html.

Instructions for building FOP from source code:

    FOP uses Apache Ant as its build system.  You can download Apache Ant
    from http://ant.apache.org.
    
    Ant installation instructions:
    1. Download and install Ant
    2. Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the directory where you've
       placed Ant.
    3. Add "%%ANT_HOME%%\bin" to your PATH so the "ant.bat" batch file
       can be executed from wherever needed.
    4. (optional) Download JUnit and place junit-*.jar in %%ANT_HOME%%\lib.
       This enables the JUnit test cases.
	
    After Ant is installed, you can build FOP simply by navigating to
    the FOP base directory and typing "ant".
