<s1 title="Introduction">
<p>
<note><p>
The information here is still in the early stage, some information
may be wrong or misleading. In general there is not a broad enough
input and it is lacking in depth of information.
</p></note>
The information here describes the design and architecture details for FOP.
Currently this is part of a redesign process for some of the core parts of
FOP.
  </p>
  <p>
The redesign is mainly focusing on some particular process involved
with the layout process when converting the FO tree into the Area Tree.
  </p>
<s2 title="Aims">
  <p>
The main aim for FOP is to comply with the spec and to be able to
process files of any size.
   </p>
  <p>
In achieving this aim we need to understand the problem and break it
into small problems that can be solved.
   </p>
  <p>
<ul>
<li>use SAX as input</li>
<li>process FO elements ASAP</li>
<li>dispose of unused memory, keep memory minimal</li>
<li>layout handles floats, footnotes and keeps in a simple straight forward way</li>
<li>id references are kept simple</li>
<li>pages are rendered ASAP, can be cached until resolved</li>
<li>renderers are totally responsible for their output format</li>
<li>output is sent to a stream</li>
</ul>
   </p>
